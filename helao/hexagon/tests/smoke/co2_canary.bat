REM ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REM Windows canary for the co2hex hexagon cut-over: runtime /openapi.json diff.
REM
REM Launches the LEGACY co2 group and the HEXAGON co2hex group in turn, dumps
REM each CO2SENSOR server's live /openapi.json, and diffs them. An identical
REM route/schema surface proves the hexagon makeActionApp factory produces a
REM byte-parity action server for the co2sensor_server (SprintIR-6S CO2 sensor)
REM cut-over target.
REM
REM Why NOT parity_run.sh / harness.capture: that harness is hardcoded to the
REM golden SIM group topology (orch@8001, sim@8002, db@8010) and dispatches
REM sequences to an orchestrator. co2hex is a 2-server group (CO2SENSOR@8012 +
REM ACTVIS@5001) with NO orchestrator, so the GM-* scenarios cannot drive it.
REM The openapi diff is the topology-appropriate parity check (mirrors
REM spec_canary.bat / galil_canary.bat / gamryhex_canary.bat exactly). See
REM co2_diff.bat for the runtime acquire_co2 golden diff, the topology-
REM appropriate DATA check.
REM
REM Both configs share root C:\INST_hlo and ports 8012/5001, so they MUST run
REM sequentially (this script does that) -- never launch both at once.
REM NOTE: co2.yml's simulation:true is cosmetic (banner color) -- SprintIR has
REM no sim/dummy data path (see golden_capture_co2.py). SprintIR.connect() opens
REM the serial port (COM12) and configures the physical sensor at startup; the
REM sensor should be attached so the server boots and serves /openapi.json (a
REM data-producing action additionally requires it, see co2_diff.bat).

REM Guard: refuse an unsafe root (drive/fs anchor, or a root that contains the
REM code repo) BEFORE anything touches it. safe_root.py is the single choke
REM point; %ROOT% is only ever used read-only in this script, but the check is
REM defense in depth against a mis-set root: key. See safe_root.py.
REM NOTE: `conda` is conda.bat on Windows -- every conda call in this script's
REM own flow MUST be prefixed with `call`, else the parent batch terminates when
REM conda.bat returns (silent exit). Only the conda inside `start ... cmd /c` is
REM exempt (it runs in a separate child shell).

REM (e.g. C:\INST_hlo) holds production RUN data, calibration matrices, and may
REM contain the code repo itself -- deleting it is catastrophic and unrecoverable
REM (rmdir /s /q bypasses the Recycle Bin). %ROOT% is used read-only here, only

REM server then fails to bind and falls back to the 0.0.0.0 wildcard while the
REM stale binder keeps the loopback port, so the RPC-first action dispatch
REM reaches the STALE binder (ACK'd but never executed) -> a silent capture
REM hang. Wait for both ports to release before launching (mirrors :kill_one).

:kill_one
REM 0) GRACEFUL shutdown FIRST so the SprintIR driver's shutdown() runs:
REM SprintIR.shutdown() closes the serial port (COM12). A hard kill skips this
REM and may leave the port claimed for the next launch -- best-effort (server
REM dies mid-response); then wait.
REM Snapshot the group's PIDs (servers + launch.py monitor) BEFORE the
REM graceful /shutdown, so teardown / a removed pickle can't defeat the
REM kill and the launch.py console window is closed by PID (see kill_group.py).

REM 2) kill the launch.py monitor (+ its conda/cmd wrapper) for THIS prefix by
REM matching its command line -- precise, so it can never hit the canary console.
REM `taskkill /T /F` by window title was removed: /T tree-kills and can cascade
REM through a shared conhost.exe and close the main canary window.

REM 3) WAIT for the CO2SENSOR server's HTTP + co-located ZMQ RPC ports (RPC =
REM HTTP+10000 = 18012) to actually RELEASE before returning. The RPC listener
REM is a thread inside the server process and lives as long as the process does;
REM if the next sequential launch (co2 vs co2hex) starts while a stale listener
REM still owns 127.0.0.1:18012, the CO2SENSOR "Address in use" fallback fires
REM AND a dispatch_action RPC-first call would reach the STALE binder -- the
REM action is ACK'd but never runs on the live server, yielding an empty capture
REM (statuses={}). Poll both ports until free (~30s cap).
