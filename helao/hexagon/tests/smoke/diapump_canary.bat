REM ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REM Windows canary for the diapumphex hexagon cut-over: runtime /openapi.json diff.
REM
REM Launches the LEGACY diapump group and the HEXAGON diapumphex group in turn,
REM dumps each DOSEPUMP server's live /openapi.json, and diffs them. An identical
REM route/schema surface proves the hexagon makeActionApp factory produces a
REM byte-parity action server for the diapump_server (diaphragm dosing pump)
REM cut-over target.
REM
REM OPENAPI-ONLY (single tier -- NO runtime golden-diff tier). Every diapump
REM action (run_continuous, dispense_byvolume, dispense_byrate) actively DRIVES
REM fluid; none is a safe non-perturbing read, so there is no valid runtime golden
REM scenario the way cam's acquire_image is. The /openapi.json surface diff done
REM here is the whole harness -- same openapi-only precedent as dbpack_canary.sh
REM and analysis_canary.sh.
REM
REM Why NOT parity_run.sh / harness.capture: that harness is hardcoded to the
REM golden SIM group topology (orch@8001, sim@8002, db@8010) and dispatches
REM sequences to an orchestrator. diapumphex is a 1-server group (DOSEPUMP@8016)
REM with NO orchestrator (mirrors cam_canary.bat exactly).
REM
REM Both configs share root C:\INST_hlo and port 8016, so they MUST run
REM sequentially (this script does that) -- never launch both at once.
REM NOTE: this openapi canary only boots each server and reads /openapi.json; it
REM never dispatches an action, so no pump ever moves fluid and no COM device
REM needs to be present (the sim/dummy driver serves the route surface).
REM
REM Usage: diapump_canary.bat [root] [outdir]
REM   root   default C:\INST_hlo   (must match the configs' root: key)
REM   outdir default %TEMP%\diapump_canary

REM Guard: refuse an unsafe root (drive/fs anchor, or a root that contains the
REM code repo) BEFORE anything touches it. safe_root.py is the single choke
REM point; %ROOT% is only ever used read-only in this script, but the check is
REM defense in depth against a mis-set root: key. See safe_root.py.
REM NOTE: `conda` is conda.bat on Windows -- every conda call in this script's
REM own flow MUST be prefixed with `call`, else the parent batch terminates when
REM conda.bat returns (silent exit). Only the conda inside `start ... cmd /c` is
REM exempt (it runs in a separate child shell).

REM server then fails to bind and falls back to the 0.0.0.0 wildcard while the
REM stale binder keeps the loopback port, so the RPC-first action dispatch
REM reaches the STALE binder (ACK'd but never executed) -> a silent capture
REM hang. Wait for both ports to release before launching (mirrors :kill_one).

REM 0) GRACEFUL shutdown FIRST so the diapump driver's shutdown() runs cleanly.
REM The dosing pump holds a serial COM handle in a real deployment; graceful
REM shutdown lets the driver release it. Best-effort (server may die
REM mid-response); then wait.
REM Snapshot the group's PIDs (servers + launch.py monitor) BEFORE the
REM graceful /shutdown, so teardown / a removed pickle can't defeat the
REM kill and the launch.py console window is closed by PID (see kill_group.py).

REM 2) kill the launch.py monitor (+ its conda/cmd wrapper) for THIS prefix by
REM matching its command line -- precise, so it can never hit the canary console.
REM `taskkill /T /F` by window title was removed: /T tree-kills and can cascade
REM through a shared conhost.exe and close the main canary window.
REM The match includes ".yml" so prefix "diapump" cannot match "diapumphex".

REM 3) WAIT for the DOSEPUMP server's HTTP + co-located ZMQ RPC ports (RPC =
REM HTTP+10000 = 18016) to actually RELEASE before returning. The RPC listener
REM is a thread inside the server process and lives as long as the process does;
REM if the next sequential launch (diapump vs diapumphex) starts while a stale
REM listener still owns 127.0.0.1:18016, the next launch's "Address in use"
REM fallback fires and a dispatch_action RPC-first call would reach the STALE
REM binder -- yielding a broken surface. Poll both ports until free (~30s cap).
